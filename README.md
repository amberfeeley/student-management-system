# Student Management System

## Objective
This is a Java-based Student Management System (SMS) that can handle various operations, including adding students, tracking grades, calculating averages, and generating reports. The goal is to reinforce concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), file handling, and user interaction using Java.

## Project Overview
We are working in a group to create a fully functional SMS. The system is a console-based application with the following features:
- Adding, removing, and updating student records
- Tracking student grades for multiple subjects
- Generating reports (e.g., average grade, highest/lowest performers)
- Saving and loading student data from a file
- All classes are contained within the `src` folder
  
## Repositories and Terminology
Here is some information about repositories and some repository terminology.
[GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/about-repositories)
We will be making clones of the main code, creating new branches to work on, then merging our branches into main.
Everyone can then pull from main to apply the newly added code.
Here is some information on branches.

## Version Control
Git allows users to clone the repository, creating a local copy of the code on each computer. This enables each person to make changes locally before uploading the changes to the main code. It ensures that everyone is working with the same version of the code as updates are made. Git also allows users to revert all changes from the branch, if needed, without losing the data on the main branch.

## Cloning the Repository
To clone the repository to your computer, follow the instructions in the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository).
Ensure your terminal is in the folder you would like to the repository to be in.
Here is an example of a repository that has been successfully cloned. ![Screenshot 2024-10-24 at 9 04 14 PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/15dcc82e-f96b-4460-bcd3-fe8cb5906219)
The repository can then be found in the associated folder. ![Screenshot 2024-10-24 at 9 08 22 PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/93742a45-4d32-4a5e-bae4-84fd9cd6f6ae)

## Branches
For each issue, please create a new branch. Avoid working directly in the main branch to prevent conflicts and unexpected issues.

## Rebasing
As issues are completed and merged into the main branch, we may need to rebase to ensure that everyone has the same code updates. This practice helps to prevent fatal errors from different branches.

## Git Operations

### Pulls
- **Definition**: A pull is used to fetch the latest/existing content from a remote repository and it updates that latest content into your current working branch/repository.

### Commits
- **Definition**: A commit is a snapshot of your changes in the repository. It includes a message describing the changes made.
- **Best Practices**: Write clear and concise commit messages.
- Example messages:
    - `Added feature to track student grades`
    - `Fixed bug in student record update`

### Pushes
- **Definition**: Pushing sends your committed changes to the remote repository on GitHub.
- **When to Push**: Push changes when you’ve completed a feature, fixed a bug, or want to share your progress with the team.

## Issues
I created the issues based on the information we were given about the assignment. We can add more issues as needed or break issues down into smaller chunks.
Anyone of us should be able to add or create issues. We can assign an issue to ourselves to show who is working on which issue.

Please be sure to create a new branch to work on the issue. You will want to make sure that you checkout to that branch and not to main.

After an issue is finished, make a commit and push the issue so that it can be merged with the main branch. Git will keep track of the commits for version control.
Commits can be reviewed by other teammembers before being saved to main.
