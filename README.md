# student-management-system
Java Group Project

Objective:
Develop a Java-based Student Management System (SMS) that can handle various operations,
including adding students, tracking grades, calculating averages, and generating reports. The
goal is to reinforce concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), file handling, and user
interaction using Java.

Project Overview:
We are working in a group to create a fully functional SMS. The system is a console-based
application with the following features:
- Adding, removing, and updating student records
- Tracking student grades for multiple subjects
- Generating reports (e.g., average grade, highest/lowest performers)
- Saving and loading student data from a file
