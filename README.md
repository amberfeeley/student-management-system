# Student Management System

## Objective
This is a Java-based Student Management System (SMS) that can handle various operations, including adding students, tracking grades, calculating averages, and generating reports. The goal is to reinforce concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), file handling, and user interaction using Java.

## Project Overview
We are working in a group to create a fully functional SMS. The system is a console-based application with the following features:
- Adding, removing, and updating student records
- Tracking student grades for multiple subjects
- Generating reports (e.g., average grade, highest/lowest performers)
- Saving and loading student data from a file
  
## Repositories and Terminology
Here is some information about repositories and some repository terminology.
[GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/about-repositories)
We will be making clones of the main code, creating new branches to work on, then mergining our branches to main.
Here is some information on branches.

## Version Control
Git allows users to clone the repository, creating a local copy of the code on each computer. This enables each person to make changes locally before uploading the changes to the main code. It ensures that everyone is working with the same version of the code as updates are made. Git also allows users to revert all changes from the branch, if needed, without losing the data on the main branch.

## Cloning the Repository
To clone the repository to your computer, follow the instructions in the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository).

## Branches
For each issue, please create a new branch. Avoid working directly in the main branch to prevent conflicts and unexpected issues.

## Rebasing
As issues are completed and merged into the main branch, we may need to rebase to ensure that everyone has the same code updates. This practice helps to prevent fatal errors from different branches.

## Git Operations

### Commits
- **Definition**: A commit is a snapshot of your changes in the repository. It includes a message describing the changes made.
- **Best Practices**: Write clear and concise commit messages. For example:
- 'Added feature to track student grades Fixed bug in student record update'
### Pushes
- **Definition**: Pushing sends your committed changes to the remote repository on GitHub.
- **When to Push**: Push changes when youâ€™ve completed a feature, fixed a bug, or want to share your progress with the team.

### Pull Requests
- **Definition**: A pull request (PR) is a request to merge your changes from your branch into the main branch.
- **Review Process**: All pull requests should be reviewed by at least one other team member before merging to ensure code quality and consistency.
